# Expo Example

This is an example project demonstrating how to use react-native-godot with Expo.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Update the Godot project path in `App.tsx` to point to your Godot project.

3. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn start
```

## Running the Example

- Press `i` to run on iOS simulator
- Press `a` to run on Android emulator
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your physical device

## Notes

- This example uses Expo's development build since react-native-godot requires native modules
- Make sure you have the necessary Godot project files in the specified path
- The example demonstrates basic integration of GodotView in a React Native application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are properly installed
2. Verify that your Godot project path is correct
3. Check that you're using a compatible version of Expo and React Native
