# Example using React Native Godot

## Usage

Use `yarn` for this example as we use a certain feature `link:...` to use the `react-native-godot` package locally.

```sh
# To launch metro debugger
$ yarn start
# To launch the app for iOS
$ yarn ios
# To launch the app for Android
$ yarn android
# To pack your assets in the iOS/Android app (needed when updating assets)
$ yarn asset
```
